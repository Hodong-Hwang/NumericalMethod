This code solves the 2D unsteady-state diffusion equation ∂T/∂t = ∇⋅(k∇T) using the unsteady-state form of the finite volume method. The problem domain is defined as a 2D grid with nx cells in the x direction and ny cells in the y direction, and the solution is advanced in time using a time step size of dt for nt time steps. The initial condition is defined as a square region with higher temperature than the surroundings. The thermal conductivity is set to k=1.0, the density is set to `rho=1
